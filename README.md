# daily_programmer_challenges
A repository for reddit/dailyprogrammer coding challenges 

## Disclaimer

All challenges have been done by me. I am using the challenges to learn coding, so they might not be very efficient or aesthetically pleasing. I just started out programming, so before challenge 1 I had no experience whatsoever. 
I am always open for suggestions, so please contact me for any ideas on how to improve.

### Challenge 239
(Link to reddit post)[https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/3r7wxz/20151102_challenge_239_easy_a_game_of_threes/]

This gave me a hard time figuring out how to change the value of the array within the "game"-function. I thought that it is enough to say p = digitsum(p), but it didn't change the value within the array, hence why I added an iteration with "i". I still have to find out why this is necessary.

Anyway, I am very proud to having done this within 24 hours of learning python :). On to the next one!
